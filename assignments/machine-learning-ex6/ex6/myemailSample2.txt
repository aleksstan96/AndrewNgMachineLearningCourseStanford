coursera logoYour progress in Week 1
It looks like you didn’t finish all of this weeks assignments in time for the Sunday, November 22 due date. That’s okay—you can still turn it in.
Due dates are meant to help you stay on track, but aren’t required. As long as you pass all of your assignments by the end of the course December 20, 11:59 PM PST, you’ll earn your certificate. There are only 2 weeks left, so try to get caught up as soon as you can.

Welcome to Week 2 of Learning How to Learn!

This week's exciting material involves the very foundation of learning—the ability to form neural "chunks." We’ll talk about how you can form chunks, how you can use them to improve your understanding and creativity with the material, and how chunks can help you to do better on tests.

All this, and more, in this week's Learning How to Learn.

Let's get started!

Barb, Terry, and the entire Learning How to Learn team
