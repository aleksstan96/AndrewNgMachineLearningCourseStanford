Dear Aleksandra Stanojevic,
We wanted to let you know that your course access through our Coursera for Campus Response Initiative ends on November 30. To view the courses visit My Courses
This means that courses enrolled through your program before September 30 will be downgraded, and you will no longer see them under “My Courses”. They will still be shown on your consumer Coursera page in audit mode, which includes non-graded content only (e.g. videos, readings). To navigate there, click the arrow at the top left of the screen and select “My Coursera”. You can always pay to regain full access, or reach out to your school administration to provide additional Coursera access.
As you strive to complete courses before November 30, please note that peer review assignments typically take several days to complete and depends on the availability of peers in the course.
Your program was transitioned to our Basic / Student plan on October 1, which provides one additional course enrollment and unlimited Guided Project enrollments. So if you haven’t enrolled in any courses since September 30, you can use the additional enrollment on any available course in your program under “Browse Catalog”.
We see that you are enrolled in the following courses below.

The Data Scientist’s Toolbox
from Johns Hopkins University

Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects
from McMaster University, University of California San Diego
